# Hi, I'm Parth Bisht. 👋
### GenAI Engineer & Product Builder.

I bridge the gap between **Deep Learning research** and **shipping products**. I don't just train models; I deploy them.

- 🗣️ **Challenge:** Building 10 Voice Agents in 10 Days (Murf AI Challenge).
- 🇯🇵 **Goal:** Studying for **JLPT N4** & seeking AI Engineering Internships in Tokyo/Remote.
