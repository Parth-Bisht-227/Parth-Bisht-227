# Hi, I'm Parth Bisht. 👋

### AI Engineer | Agentic AI & Voice Systems
I'm a builder at heart, passionate about turning **Deep Learning concepts** into **functional, interactive applications**. I love exploring new tech stacks, documenting my learning journey, and moving beyond notebooks to ship working prototypes.

- 🎙️ **Just Shipped:** [Real-Time Agentic Voice Suite](https://github.com/Parth-Bisht-227/voice-agent-murf-falcon-10-day-challenge) — A system of 10 context-aware voice agents with sub-second latency using LiveKit, Deepgram & Silero VAD.
- 🎨 **Deployed:** [Manga-Splasher](https://manga-splasher.streamlit.app/) — A Pix2Pix GAN deployed on Streamlit for instant manga colorization.
- 🚀 **Current Focus:** Seeking **AI Engineering Internships** (India/Japan) & leveling up my **Japanese (JLPT N5)**. I'm also actively building cool side projects and creating content around new tech I learn.
